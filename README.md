# metacognition-confidence-gpt
This repository contains data and analysis code for the study "Metacognition of ChatGPT in confidence judgements."


## Repository Structure and Workflow

This repository is organized to separate **data generation**, **statistical analysis**, and **raw data storage** in a clear and reproducible manner.

### Entry point

- `0_open_this_first.R`  
  This script should be opened first in RStudio.  
  It automatically sets the working directory to the root of this repository.

All subsequent scripts assume this directory as the working directory and use **relative paths** throughout.

---

### Data

- `1_raw_data/`  
  Contains all raw data used in the analyses, including human response data and ChatGPT-generated data.

---

### Analysis scripts

Directories whose names start with a **number** contain statistical analysis scripts, organized by analysis topic:

- `2_correct_rate_confidence`
- `3_correlation_corr_conf`
- `4_conf_correct_vs_incorrect`
- `5_AUROC`
- `6_meta_I`
- `7_folded-x`

Each directory name indicates the main analysis performed within it.

---

### ChatGPT data generation

- `A_ChatGPT_data_generation/`  
  Contains scripts used to generate ChatGPT responses via the OpenAI API.

Directories starting with `A_` are reserved for **ChatGPT-related data generation code** and are separate from statistical analyses.
